    <h1>{{ algorithm_name }}BAT Algorithm</h1>
    <p>This page provides an in-depth explanation and results for the powerful and efficient {{ algorithm_name }} algorithm. Explore the different aspects of the algorithm below, from its workings to its practical applications and performance metrics.</p>

    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Introduction to the Bat Algorithm</h2>
        <p>The <span class="highlight">{{ algorithm_name }}</span> is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the echolocation behavior of bats. Bats have the ability to use sound waves to navigate and locate prey, even in complete darkness. Similarly, this algorithm mimics their behavior to search for the optimal solution in complex optimization problems.</p>
        <p>It is particularly useful in solving problems related to function optimization, engineering design, and machine learning tasks where the solution space is large and complex.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Key Features Section -->
    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Key Features of the Bat Algorithm</h2>
        <p>The Bat Algorithm is designed to balance exploration (searching globally) and exploitation (fine-tuning local solutions). Some of its key features include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Frequency Tuning:</strong> Bats adjust their frequency to adapt to different search regions and find optimal solutions.</li>
            <li><strong>Echolocation:</strong> Using echolocation, bats are capable of "scanning" their environment and narrowing down their search towards the best solution.</li>
            <li><strong>Movement Based on Fitness:</strong> The bats' movement and frequency depend on the quality (fitness) of the current solution, encouraging a progressive search toward better solutions.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Behavior:</strong> Bats' behavior changes dynamically, which enhances the algorithm's ability to explore the solution space more effectively.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Algorithm Workflow -->
    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>How Does the Bat Algorithm Work?</h2>
        <p>The Bat Algorithm operates in a loop, with bats representing potential solutions that adjust their frequency, velocity, and position based on the evaluation of their fitness in the solution space. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Initialization:</strong> A set of bats is initialized with random positions and velocities in the search space.</li>
            <li><strong>Fitness Evaluation:</strong> The fitness of each bat is evaluated based on the optimization problem.</li>
            <li><strong>Movement and Frequency Adjustment:</strong> Each bat adjusts its frequency and position towards the best solution found so far.</li>
            <li><strong>Exploration and Exploitation:</strong> Some bats explore the solution space, while others exploit the most promising areas, maintaining a balance between exploration and exploitation.</li>
            <li><strong>Iteration:</strong> This process is repeated for a set number of iterations or until a convergence criterion is met.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
